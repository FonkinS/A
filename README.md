# A
**A** is a programming language made to target the 6502 CPU, for work on projects such as games for the NES.

It is all in a single C file, making it easy to use and compile for any platform. 

## How to use:

Simply compile the program using a compiler such as GCC or Clang and then run the program with the added argument of [YourFilesName]


## Syntax:
The syntax is fairly straightforward in A, being a mix of C and Python.

There are no curly braces, and you must instead use indentation (No spaces, only tabs).
You declare functions with the keyword **func** and variables with the keyword for the type of variable you wish to define. *A* contains the following datatypes: **int** and **bool**

**while** and **if** statements are supported, with the argument being put straight after the keyword, and a **:** at the end of the line

If you are in doubt, please check the sample files in the *Sample Files* directory



PLEASE BE AWARE THAT **A** IS STILL IN A ALPHA STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, AND BUGS ARE PLENTIFUL
